Alex Bruce and I worked together. We worked on pretty much everything at the same time together. 
For the after glow Alex did the explanation and I combined the code for part 2. 
For the pi hacking I wrote out the geometry equations and Alex did the plot description. 
In the pi hacking, we saw that with random sampling you can find out information without having to derive things. 
In the after glow, we tried different types of fitting using different weighting functions, and learned how to accuretly test out fits.
