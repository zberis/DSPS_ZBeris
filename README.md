# DSPS_ZBeris
I decided to take the class because I feel like I do not know a lot about data science and it would be helpful to learn more.
What I hope to get out of this class is a better understanding of data science and how to better implement it in research. 
Some strengths that will help me in this class is that I have some experience using Jupyter notebooks and using google Colab for collaborative projects.
