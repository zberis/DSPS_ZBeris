The first plot is the one that remade, and the second one is the original plot. I think you did a good job in making this plot more clear.
The new plot basically repsect most of the 5 Tufte's rules. Suggestion I can give is that the range of scatter in x-axis for a single cluster could be smaller. As
we could see in the first plot, hollow appeared inside the data cluster, and which actually did not all come from the real data. The sparsity in
real data actually only contribute verticall component of the hollow, and the other part comes from the randomness of x-axis, which might cause misleading in data distribution. Also, I don't think the different color 
is necessary, since the information already contained in spatial distribution. 
For the error bar, I would suggest you contain it in someway, although I don't have a good idea how to contain it properly so far. It quite important
in most of cases.
It is great that you eliminate the vertical grid line and decimal part of x tick.

To sum up, I think you made a improve in ambiguity, and it could be further improved. For the 5 rules, design vairation could reduced if the scatter range decrease. I think the plot respect color practices. I don't think this plot should consider about color-blind since there is no dimention in data that need to be represented by different color.


For the bad image in your hw, I absolutely agree with you, there are two many information overlap with each other.
However, I would group them differently based on my purpose, or using the different color code. In a single plot, I will try
different color that has huge contrast, like red blue and green, instead of red orange and yellow.
This plot really bad in ambiguity, and not respect second rule. Also, this plot didn't consider about the color. It is really bad.
