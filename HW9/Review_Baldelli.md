## The remade plot
Remade plot:

Original plot:

<img width="562" height="441" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4565ad20-6d01-480d-9aef-0d20837529be" />

I like that you can more clearly see the data point density in this new plot, but the horizontal spread 
increases confusion about the discrete clusters, making them appear not to be a discrete group. I don't know if this distortion is worth the 
increased visibility. I wonder if the use of three box and whisker plots for each group might be benifical for this visualization.

The simplified horizontal axis increases the data-to-ink ratio and emphasizes that there are only three discrete options. 
I think having two lines to separate the three groups may have helps to show that there is only 3 groups

The colors, while aesthetically pleasing, violate Tufte's rule for redundency, by adding a dimension to the data that does not carry any new information.
However, as this plot is rather simple I don't find the colors distracting and I think they could be useful especially if they were used consistently across related plots.
In addition the colors I believe are from the plasma colormap and therefore are colorblind friendly.

Overall, I think this plot communicates the information well and while some improvements could be made the abiguity and data/ink ratio were improved in this iteration.

## The "Bad Plot"

This plot has alot of information to the point of distraction and uninterperatability. 
If someone was looking to compare two lines within this plot I do not think it would be an easily acomplished task, especially if they wished to look at the yellow line that is not visible in this plot.
The colors used are most definately not color blind friendly, given that red green and blue yellow are the two most common types of color blindness.
As Zoe stated, I would definately split up these plots, and also introduce a reduced alpha to the lines to increase the visibility of individual lines.

The labels on the side are highly redundent considering about $\frac{1}{6}$ th of the plots space is taken up by the words "ScaADoc". Prehaps this should be in the title of the plot instead.
In addition, I wonder if the labels are intuitive to the reader (as I do not know what the graph is about) or if there is better label that could be used to show what is really changing between various lines.
The annotation at the top of the plot stating α-carbon similarly, maybe of note to the reader, but to my untrained eyes appears to be chart junk or something that could have been included in the title of the plot.

Overall this plot has low scores in terms of ambiguity, distraction, data/ink, redundancy, and junk.
