I remade the scatter plot from Homework 7 that was showing where the different countries were clustered. 
I spread out the dots so that they weren't overlapping as much, and I also added colors in order to make the plot more visually appealing.
I also got rid of the vertical grid lines as I wanted to make it clear that the countries can only be clustered in 0, 1 and 2. 
I chose to get rid of the error bars as they were very small and did not add much to the take away of the plot.

This is the bad plot that I got from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jmr.2380. 
In order to improve it I would split it into 3 different plots, doing the three groups that are grouped already, the greens and then the blues and then the reds. 
I would also check about how this looks to color blind people as I do not know how well identifyable these colors are. I would also then make sure that the colors are easier to identify.

This is my good image which is from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eml.2015.07.001. 
I think this is a good plot because there are not too many lines and the colors are very distinct from eachother.
